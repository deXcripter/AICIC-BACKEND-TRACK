### üåê Exercise 3: Create a Basic HTTP Server that Sends File Content

**Goal:** Combine `http.createServer` with `fs.readFileSync`.

**Task:**
- Create a file named `server.js`.
- Create another file called `homepage.txt` with any welcome message.
- In `server.js`, create an HTTP server that:
  - Listens on port 3000.
  - Sends the content of `homepage.txt` as the response when someone visits `http://localhost:3000`.

**Expected Output in Browser:**
```
This is my first Node.js server!
```

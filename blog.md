# Blog Application â€“ Backend API Project

## Introduction

This backend project will guide you through building a fully-featured blog system API. You'll implement authentication, CRUD operations, role-based access control, search functionality, and user engagement features like comments and likes.

Each section below outlines specific features to implement with explicit endpoint requirements. Work through them sequentially as each builds upon previous sections.
